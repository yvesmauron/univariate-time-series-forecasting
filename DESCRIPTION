Description: This package implements intelligent algorithms such as time series forecasting that can be easily integrated into BI solutions designed using the Microsoft Stack by calling the sp_execute_external_script stored procedure. This document describes all the functions implemented in the package, whereas a user documentation, which describes how these can be used in SQL Server, can be found <here>.
